# Knowledge Infused AI

This is a research initiative by Intuit AI Research and focuses on techniques and methodologies to incorporate knowledge of various forms to improve the performance of AI systems. Some of our work in this space include -
- Hallucination detection and mitigation :- [(SAC3)](#sac3-reliable-hallucination-detection-in-black-box-language-models-via-semantic-aware-cross-check-consistency)Semantic-aware cross-check consistency, [DCR-Consistency](#dcr-consistency--divide-conquer-reasoning-for-consistency-evaluation-and-improvement-of-large-language-models): Divide-Conquer-Reasoning for Consistency Evaluation and Improvement of Large Language Models
- Uncertainty quantification :- [SPUQ](#spuq--perturbation-based-uncertainty-quantification-for-large-language-models): Perturbation-Based Uncertainty Quantification for Large Language Models
